# FootPressureMapping
Passion project for a device to track pressure on different parts of the foot during a squat motion. This would help diagnose foot, ankle, knee, and hip form imbalances and evaluate the overall health of squat physics.


I plan to create a physical insole with 3-6 sensors per foot to gather pressure data over time. However, current implementation is the software side that will be tested with fake data. Once that is complete, I will update readme.
